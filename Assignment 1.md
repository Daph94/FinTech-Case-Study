# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study
## Overview and Origin

![Beanworks](https://www.bctechnology.com/tmp/news/D41D8CD98F00B204E9800998ECF8427E73807B18E716092BB5D51861D6C9BF29.jpg)

* When was the company incorporated?

  * *2012*
* Who are the founders of the company? 
  * *Catherine Dahl, Cory Cleaver, Reza Sanaie, Tracy Thompson*
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  * *With collective backgrounds in accounting, the founders recognized that accounting has many issues with paper-based accounts payable invoices. There was a clear need to serve accounting professionals in a more efficient and manageable way, so they created a cost-saving accounts payable automation software.*
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
  * *Beanworks is an early-stage venture, private company that has been funded by Series A and B rounds of investing. It has received 12.3 million dollars worth of funds since its inception.*

## Business Activities 
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  * *Beanworks is modernizing the entire AP process, from the purchase decision to invoice approval with electronic payments included in the experience. It is an accounts payable automation solution that helps companies eliminate paperwork and reduce invoice processing costs.*

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
  * *They target small, medium and large size companies. Basically, any company that has expenses every month, can benefit from this automation.*
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

  * *Beanworks can integrate seamlessly with the accounting software of the company. There is no time wasted importing and exporting data. Beanworks imports lists from the accounting software so they are available for coding right away. Transactions from the accounting software such as payments and purchase order feeds can also be imported. Output files are configured to be imported back to the accounting software—meaning no double entry.*

     *Another advantage is that Beanworks partnered with Sage back in November 2016. Sage, a market leader for integrated accounting, payroll and payment systems, now offers Beanworks as their official AP automation provider in North America.*

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
  * *Beanworks uses **SmartCoding technology** for invoices. Smart coding eliminates the need for a human to manually code invoices when there is no purchase order (PO) created to match to that invoice. Using a new state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, smart coding technology automatically searches and analyzes historical data and invoice coding templates to recommend the proper general ledger (GL) coding of non-PO invoices. These invoices would otherwise get trapped in a time-consuming, manual workflow. By leveraging and learning from company financial data, the technology is able to continuously improve the accuracy of its recommendations – increasing efficiency, productivity and accuracy of invoice handling.*


    *Smart coding also helps companies collect and aggregate more financial data for the future by automating processing across another invoice format.*
        
    *Beanworks uses its client's current Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software and integrates extra features and functionalities within the ERP to meet the unique business and industry needs of its clients. Companies using accounting software like Sage, QuickBooks, and NetSuite often turn to Beanworks for that extra boost of AP automation power. Not only does Beanworks use configurable workflow rules for purchase orders and invoices, it can also quickly see where an invoice is in the approval process at any given time, and manage critical AP processes from the mobile app.*

## Landscape
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? 
  * *Accounting & Expense Management*

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
  * *The last few years have made it clear, that integrated software that syncs up a business’ financial information on a single platform makes it much easier to track and time payments in order to successfully manage cash flow. CPAs that haven't embraced this marriage of technology and financial services need to get on board, because it's an area that's poised for exponential growth in the coming years.*
      
      *At the heart of the value proposition of this new technology is the integration of various platforms for handling accounting tasks. This includes everything from cash flow management and payroll, to invoicing and employee time tracking. The real-time integration of these tasks also yields invaluable business intelligence.*
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
  * Bench Accounting
  * SAP Concur
  * FreshBooks Cloud Accounting
  * MindBridge
  * Procurify
  * Sage

## Results

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
  * *AP Automation companies use the following metrics to understand & map their performances:*
      * Cost per invoice
      * Invoice Processing Speed 
      * Productivity per Team Member
      * Variance Analysis – Correction Rate
      * PO Matching Speed
  * *Beanworks uses a system where the price is based on the number of invoices a company generates in a month. You can choose your plan based on the volume of invoices you expect. According to its website, Beanworks processes more than $13 billion in AP spend.*

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
  * *Companies in this domain provide technology for accounting and tax, bookkeeping, and expense management players. They leverage technology to provide these services directly to end-users. For instance, Bench Accounting (disclosed equity funding of US $44.22M) syncs with a company’s books and employs professional bookkeepers to provides tax-ready financial statements.*  

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
  * *Beanworks solely focuses on purchase orders, invoices and payments. They are a fairly small company so far, that is yet to branch out to other accounting services like managing taxes. I would suggest they offer a wider variety of services like cash flow management and payroll.*

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  * *It is important for a company to keep growing by diverifying its services and not stagnating, in order to keep up with competitors like Bench Accounting that have already got their roots into tax management.    
  Without an integrated approach that enables accounting professionals to have a real-time view of the firm's revenue and outlays, or that automates the issuance of invoices by considering upcoming expenses, firms risk a shortfall of cash when it comes time to fund payroll or other needs.*

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  * *It goes without saying that Machine learning and AI will play a big part in integrating all systems into one. In order to create enough data storage, Beanworks will also need to embrace the cloud with open arms.*

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  * *Machine learning is used in finance quite often for pattern recognition. AI can be a means to produce better, faster, and more accurate predictions. This would help a company like Beanworks to perform expense and cash flow forecasting for its clients. This would make the Financial Controller's job much easier and more efficient.*
